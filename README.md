This is my ACLTC final project.

It is meant to push the limits of my learning of multiple topics covered in class, which includes Ruby, Rails, database modeling.

To run seed file:
1. In your terminal, run: rake db:create
2. In your terminal, run: rake db:migrate
3. In your terminal, run: rake db:seed
